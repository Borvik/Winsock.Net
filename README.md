# Winsock.Net

Winsock.Net is a project originally started in 2005 as a way to make network communication in .Net as simple as the Winsock control from VB6.

Since it's original inception it has evolved into what you find here.  It still _attempts_ to be as simple as that Winsock control, but it has grown to embrace what .Net has to offer.

Please see the demo project for an example of how to use this component.
